# Music Releases

A pair programming project where the aim was to use React components to build a page which shows new album and single releases.

## The problem

We used React to build the project, using information from a Spotify API. We used .map to iterate over an array of data and structured our React projects into small chunks. We made our site responsive (mobile first) with different styles for mobile, tablet and desktop. We also practiced on implementing a given design. We have styled the site using flexbox and hover effects.
